This repository contains the hardware and software implementation of my learning on robotics. It has broadly 6 practical experiments. They involve the following.
* Introduction to ROS.
* Control of Turtlebot3.
* Control of Open Manipulator X.
* End effector and trajectory control of Open Manipulator X.
* Jacobian-based control of the end effector of Open Manipulator X.
